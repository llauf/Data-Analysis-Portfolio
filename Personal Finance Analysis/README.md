# Personal Expense Analysis

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze my personal expenses data for 2023, gain insights into spending patterns, and provide recommendations for potential savings. The analysis focuses on:

* Identifying the main categories of spending.
* Understanding monthly spending behavior.
* Providing a dashboard that helps visualize the trends.

## Project Description:
Through cleaning and exploring the data, I am able to offer insights into monthly spending, category breakdowns, and any anomalies in the dataset. The final results are displayed in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Dashboard:
You can explore visualized analysis results in [this Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_17318472865040/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Key Findings:
* *Monthly Spending*: I noticed interesting trends in my spending behavior over the months, with November 2023 seeing a sharp rise in expenses.
* *Total Spending vs Income*: Over the course of the year, I ended up spending more than I earned, which highlighted the need for better financial planning.
* *Dining Out*: Dining out turned out to be the second-highest expense, even surpassing spending on health. Itâ€™s pretty clear that I should keep a closer eye on this category to avoid overspending.

## Tools and Technologies:
* Python (pandas, dotenv)
* Tableau
